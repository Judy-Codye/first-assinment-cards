            <h3>1.Firefly</h3>
            <p class="row">There are more than 2000 varieties of fireflies, found in tempe
                environments. Also called lightning bugs, they have specialized light emitting organs below their abdomen. They produce light of different colours, like yellow, green, or pale red, and emit the light in blinking patterns to attract mates. The light is also a sign of its unappetizing taste.</p>

                Jellyfish is another very well-known luminous creature. With the help of fluorescent protein, photo-protein and other bioluminescent proteins, this glorious animal can create the most beautiful underwater scenario as it emits a glow from its otherwise transparent body. Thatâ€™s why, it is a favourite animal for display in public aquariums.

            </h3>
            <p class="row">
                Also known as the New Zealand Glowworm, this fungus gnat is a luminescent creature that dwells in wet caves, humid forests and grottoes. The caves, one of the most famous being the Waitomo, are infested by these worms who form a glowing canopy as they stick to the ceilings or walls of caves, or form glow worm threads.
